NAME
    Email::MIME::Encodings - A unified interface to MIME encoding and
    decoding

SYNOPSIS
      use Email::MIME::Encodings;
      my $encoded = Email::MIME::Encodings::encode(base64 => $body);
      my $decoded = Email::MIME::Encodings::decode(base64 => $encoded);

DESCRIPTION
    This module simply wraps "MIME::Base64" and "MIME::QuotedPrint" so that
    you can throw the contents of a "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header at
    some text and have the right thing happen.

SUPPORT
    Beep... beep... this is a recorded announcement:

    I've released this software because I find it useful, and I hope you
    might too. But I am a being of finite time and I'd like to spend more of
    it writing cool modules like this and less of it answering email, so
    please excuse me if the support isn't as great as you'd like.

    Nevertheless, there is a general discussion list for users of all my
    modules, to be found at
    http://lists.netthink.co.uk/listinfo/module-mayhem

    If you have a problem with this module, someone there will probably have
    it too.
